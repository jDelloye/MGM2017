This computer program models a two-sector city with heterogeneous mobility. It aims to explore the short-run and long-run urban configurations that emerge during the establishment of a new city under exogeneous population growth.

This model was developed for the International Master in Geographical Modelling 2017 in Rouen. I assume no responsability for any other use.
